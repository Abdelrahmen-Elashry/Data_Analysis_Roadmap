<h1 align="center">Data Analysis Roadmap 2026</h1>

A complete step-by-step roadmap to become a **Data Analyst**, from fundamentals to advanced topics, with tools, skills, and project ideas.

---

## Introduction

Data Analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.
In a world full of data, a Data Analyst acts as a translator. You take "noise" (messy data) and turn it into a "story" (insights) that a business or organization can use to solve problems.

Remember, remember, remember, Data Analysis is all about the mindset, not tools at all. If you gain this mindset, you can accomplish any task, whatever the tool you use!!

Each tool we will discuss in this roadmap can be used to make a full data analysis project, but each tool is specialized in one or more tasks, so it is a best practice to learn them as much as possible as you can so you use the right tool for the right task.

But before diving into the tools, you should know the life cycle of the data first and the different roles in the field of data.

- Here are the differences between each job title:

## Overview

Data Analysis is about:
- Collecting data
- Cleaning & transforming it
- Analyzing patterns
- Visualizing insights
- Communicating results to support decision-making

This roadmap is structured into **phases**, where each phase builds on the previous one.  
All the info about the resources will be in the end of the repo.
